# C++ Learning


My problem-solving and projects designing solutions and notes in learning C++ and the other skills with dr moastafa saad ibrahim on udemy.. that is realy a comprehensive course to master 4 critical skills, as it is not only how to write C++.. it is realy about:

- Getting the problem-solving skills by doing a lot of practicing and homework.
- Getting the project-building and designing skills by building and structring a many of projects and applying the OOP Concepts and principles (which embeded in practice and hoemwrok).
- And finally the programming skills and how to program in C++ defenitly :D.

The Course covered a lot of topics to meaning direct in by the doctor's style that was follow beside explaining  the modern topics of C++17 
- *Which i have not watched yet :DD*

The Course have a lot of effort put in:
- So the **expected time** to finish was about 400 Hours ..... **from my perspective** *the doctor for sorry .. was right (lol :D)* - *Why am here?? what came me here !! :(*


## About projects

PROJECT 04:
- **The HARDEST** project as it was removed by the doctor *wasn't required* BUT the problems that i faced helped me a lot in next project

**PROJECT 06**:
- THE Best project to my heart as it designed and structured in UML classes diagrams from scratch before coding ***Think twice .. code once***
- It is applied inside it some of OOP principles like interface segreagtion principles.

- The main problem that i faced is how to communicate two classes with eachother in multi-multi relation-ship *See the other notes inside that folder*
- More of features will be added soon.

PROJECT 07 and the latest:
- A project UNDER desgining .. developing coming soon .. ***MAY_BE in Java*** *"with front-end ui + SQL management system like MySQL" or may be in C++ IDK yet.*
