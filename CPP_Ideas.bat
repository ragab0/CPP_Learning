- to fined "Find most frequent number" we iterate on the array and insert each item as a key into an object,
instead of the "frequence_array" trick which item represented as an index of it (in case items aren't big);
instead of nested loops too O(n2) "good for beginners - first time to solve";


- whenever we need "max pair of vals" then its better to get maximum two which take O(n),
instead of O(n2) in the two loops of normal solution;


- to fined "maximum two" we can assign them to first two first and compare them to which is max then with each one after,
instead of assigning to them at first to the lowest val;
